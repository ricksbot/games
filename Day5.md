# Day 5

## Business

Hello from Kansas State University Game Development Club,

Kansas State will be hosting our 5th annual Game Jam this upcoming February 8th-10th and we are looking for students from other universities who would be interested in coming to participate. Students participate for free and will have fun, food, and a great learning experience. Sign ups for our game jam and information can be found at: gdc.cs.ksu.edu! If you would be able to pass the information on to students or relevant clubs, we would love to see students from as many universities as are able to come! If you or any students have questions, please let me know! 

Thank you,

Nathan McClain
